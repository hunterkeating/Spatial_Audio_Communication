# Spatial_Audio_Communication
  
This is an in-progress project to render spatial audio when communicating between two different headsets. The project is written in python and uses Max 8 for the spatial audio plug-in. Phone sensors are used to collect orientation and location data. This project uses the IMU+GPS+STREAM android app. This project as it stands is for two way communication and requires a laptop to process and render spatial audio and and headset with microphone for each individual. The spatial audio input script parses all necessary data.
