# Spatial_Audio_Communication
  
This is an in-progress project to render spatial audio when communicating between two different headsets. The project is written in python and uses Max for the spatial audio plug-in. Phone sensors are used to collect orientation and location data. This project uses the IMU+GPS+STREAM android app.
